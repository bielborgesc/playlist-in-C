# :headphones: Playlist in C

## :mag: Objective
 - This program was developed by a group of friends in the 3rd semester of college, where we used data structures to simulate a playlist with C language.
 
## :computer: Development
 * This application uses 4 structures:
  - [music] - It contains the id, the title, the artist, the album and its duration
  - [AVL_music] - it contains a structure of type "song", an integer called "h" representing pitch, and two structures similar to themselves called "left" and "right".This structure is based on a data structure called the AVL tree.
  - [playlist_node] - contains an attribute of type "music" and a structure of the same type of itself called proximo. This structure is a linked list that represents a playlist.
  - [lplaylist_no] - contains an id, a name, an attribute which has the same type called "next", quantity and the "songs" which is an attribute of the type "node_playlist". This structure is a simple linked list, it is responsible for showing all playlists.
  - During the code there are several comments to help the understanding of the program.

## :heavy_check_mark: Concluding
  The main focus of this code is to simulate a playlist using only data structures. The aim is to demonstrate the importance of studying these structures and demonstrate that simple things in our daily lives, such as putting together a playlist, can be applied more easily with the structures that we demonstrate in the code.
  
## :arrow_forward: Run the code 
 To install and run the code we have left a tutorial for compiling the C code and running the program (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-and-run-c-cpp-code-on-visual-studio-code/).
